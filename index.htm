    <p class="paragraph">To translate words to Pig Latin, follow these steps:<br/>1. If the word does not start with a vowel, (see #3 for 'y'),
        take the consonant(s) before the first vowel and place them, in their original order, at the end of the word. Add "ay" after that,
    and voila!<br/>Ex: 'tree' --> 'eetray'. <br/><br/> 2. If the word starts with a vowel (again, see #3 for 'y'), then keep the word's original letters as is,
    and simply add 'yay', or a variation of 'yay' to the end. <br/> Ex: 'own' --> 'ownyay' <br/>Note: Other variations or dialects of Pig Latin
    replace 'yay' with 'way', 'hay', or just 'ay'. <br/><br/> 3. When a word contains the letter 'y' as either (possibly) the first vowel, or the first letter of
    the word, then treat the letter 'y' as a consonant or vowel depending on how it sounds. 'y' in 'yellow' makes a hard sound, and is considered a
    consonant. 'y' in 'psyche' makes a long 'i' sound and is considered a vowel. Once you have determined 'y''s status, take the appropriate
    action.<br/><br/>4. If a word begins with a capital letter, make the word lowercase, translate it, and then capitalize the new first character.
    If there is a capital letter that is not the first character of the untranslated word, leave it alone.</p>
